# Crypto Price Forecasting (Time Series Forecasting)

<p> In this project, I have bult a complete Crypto Price Forecasting/ Trading Bot application, in which I utilized Plotly Dash web framework, and integrated different Machine and Deep Learning algorithms for univariate and multivariate time series forecasting.  </p>

<p> The time series forecasting models inclides LSTM, GRU and Facebook Prophet </p>

<p> The user can forecast hourly and daily data in future. </p>
